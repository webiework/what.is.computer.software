Computer Software or solely Software is nothing but just a assembly of instructions to the computer to get some work as an output. 

While on the other hand talking about hardware which acts as the building block of computer in the physical sense. Now what constitutes the Computer Software? Computer software is the incorporation of Computer Programs, libraries and other data, in particular online documentation or digital media. Hardware and Software work in contrast with each other and cannot be imagined to work on its own.
